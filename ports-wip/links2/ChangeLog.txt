=== RELEASE 2.20.1 ===

Sun Sep  1 09:02:57 CEST 2019 mikulas:

	Fixed an error "ERROR: event_base_loop failed: Bad file descriptor"
	if the user quits the master instance on OpenBSD.

	OpenBSD uses an old libevent-1.4.15 and it doesn't handle calling
	event_reinit from event handler.

	libevent-2.1.11 also doesn't allow calling event_reinit from event
	handler, so it is fixed as well.

=== RELEASE 2.20 ===

Mon Aug 26 18:21:43 CEST 2019 mikulas:

	Security bug fixed: when links was connected to tor, it would send real
	dns requests outside the tor network when the displayed page contains

Tue Oct  2 00:54:24 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Windows 7 has a bug (or feature) that corrupts the screen when using the
	unaccelerated video driver - when a thread draws into window's device context
	and the user simultaneously drags the window, the device context coordinates
	may not be updated. Subsequent draws are done with incorrect coordinates.

	In order to work around this bug, we detect that a drawing operation
	possibly raced with window moving. If it did, we allocate a new DC (the
	old one is corrupted) and start a timer that asks the main thread to
	redraw the whole window using the new DC.

Sun Sep 23 22:02:09 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Add ascii replacement of Romanian S and T with comma
	Fix replacement of c with cedilla and a/i with grave accent a/o/u with

	names may clash with other programs

Sun Sep 23 00:07:29 cet 2018 mikulas:

	On OS/2, use AF_OS2 for interprocess communication because the loopback
	network device may not be properly configured.
	Fall back to 127.0.0.1 only if AF_OS2 in not installed.

Sat Sep 22 14:18:19 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Fixed a bug when IPv6 control connection to a ftp server fails and IPv4
	control connection succeeds, links would incorrectly try to make the
	data connection using IPv6 (this bug was introduced in Links 2.15).

=== RELEASE 2.17 ===

Fri Sep  7 00:04:41 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Fix verifying SSL certificates for numeric IPv6 addresses

Thu Sep  6 22:07:03 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Delete the option -ftp.fast - it doesn't always work and ftp performance
	is not an issue anymore

	Passive ftp enabled by default because it will more likely work than
	the port command

Wed Sep  5 22:39:11 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Add bold and monospaced Turkish letter 'i' without a dot

	The 8x8x4 palette has better image quality
	The 6x6x6 palette preserves gray

Sat Jul 14 04:49:45 cet 2018 mikulas:

	Implement dithering properly on OS/2 in 15-bit and 16-bit color mode

	In 8-bit mode, Links may optionally use a private palette - it
	improves visual quality of Links images, but degrades visual
	quality of other concurrently running programs.

Thu Jul 12 23:06:48 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Improve scrolling smoothness when the user drags the whole document

Thu Jul 12 06:48:00 cet 2018 mikulas:

Thu Jul 12 00:56:57 cet 2018 mikulas:

	Fixed a bug that setting terminal title and resizing a terminal didn't

	Set link color to yellow by default

Sun Jun 17 14:04:07 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	It was needed in 1999 to avoid some bug in some http server and it is
	not needed anymore

Tue Jun  5 20:24:42 CEST 2018 mikulas:

	Trust Content-Length on HTTP/1.0 redirect requests

	This fixes hangs with misbehaving servers that honor Connection:
	keep-alive but send out HTTP/1.0 reply without Connection: keep-alive.
	Links thought that they don't support keep-alive and waited for the
	connection to close (for example http://www.raspberrypi.org/)

	This improves tor hardening (the tor exit node could not differentiate
	links users from each other based on installed certificates)
	It also makes it possible to use certificate verification on systems
	with no default certificate store

	Encode strings to UTF-8 when storing them in a history, it fixes a bug
	when browsing the history if Links is run on multiple terminals with

Wed Mar 29 20:48:43 CEST 2017 mikulas:

	Use absolute time when calculating the time to flush DNS cache, HTTPS

	when malloc returns NULL, we can free some cached data and retry

Sat Feb 25 15:59:57 CET 2017 mikulas:

	Avoid reallocating the line array over and over with the same size.
	Most realloc implementations fall back to no operation if a memory chunk
	is reallocated to the same size, however, the address sanitizer always
	copies the array - this resulted in quadratic complexity and performance
	degradation on big files.

	and it accessed invalid memory.

Sat Jan 28 20:45:34 CET 2017 mikulas:

	Avoid memcpy with NULL source argument and zero length (it doesn't
	crash, but it's formally incorrect and the sanitizer warns about it)

	Make the "dns-prefetch" link prefetch just dns, not the whole document

Wed Jan 18 21:16:27 CET 2017 mikulas:

	On Windows, preload font data in a background thread, to minimize a
	stall when viewing SVG image for the first time.

Sat Oct  8 17:14:59 CEST 2016 mikulas:

	Improved tor hardening - when the user toggles the "Only Proxies" option
	(i.e. when connecting to tor), we reset certain other options to their
	default values, so that it is not possible to identify user behind tor
	based on the selected options.

Thu Oct  6 14:39:26 CEST 2016 mikulas:

	Use keys 'P' and 'L' to scroll up and down

Thu Sep 29 23:40:34 CEST 2016 Juhani Haverinen <juhani.haverinen@gmail.com>:

	Use libc tree functions from <search.h> for searching the cache

Thu Jul  7 19:39:15 CEST 2016 mikulas:

	Set the GD_NOAUTO flag for the directfb driver, so that this driver is
	never selected automatically. The directfb subsystem is buggy, it can
	corrupt graphics or even cause system crash, so select this driver only
	if the user explicitly requests it with '-driver directfb'

	Blacklist FORPSI server --- do not send Range: to it

Mon Apr 16 01:49:07 MET DST 2007 mikulas:

	Javascript was removed. The reason is that it is very buggy, Martin
	Pergel doesn't have time to develop it and code is so messy that no one
	else can understand it.

	If you use links for special purposes (embedded devices, etc.), you can
	bring javascript back by copying javascript files from previous release,
	removing "dnl javascript" lines from configure.in, adding *.c and *.h
	files to Makefile.am and re-running automake and autoconf.

	anyone else, javascript will likely be removed in next release)

Sat Mar 31 03:02:40 CEST 2007 student:

	win32.c file removed because in each new version of windows it doesn't
	work. Don't even try to fix it unless you have computers with Windows
	NT, Window 2000, Windows XP and Windows Vista side by side.

	(new Cygwin emulates xterm-like mouse on the console, so it's not needed
	for mouse)

	Cygwin sometimes doesn't send SIGWINCH, it is its bug, so I didn't try

			svgalib and framebuffer
		reportedly crashes with sdl-1.2.10
